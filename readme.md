#Conclusion


ok so... in conclusion its best to work from powershell because it updates normally

eclipse kinda breaks

does not update Unstaged items as Staged until manually 'pushed' to staged to be commited. Than and only than it checks that it(file) was already added and commited

It's fine to commit stuff from eclipse but it's preferred to push form PS and also commiting from PS gives more independence from IDE innthe future
